const PULL_REQUEST_LINKING_INSTRUCTIONS = `<pull_request_linking>
When the t3-code MCP server exposes link_pull_request, you must use it to register every pull request you create or work on for this thread. Call link_pull_request with the full PR URL immediately after creating a PR or starting work on an existing PR. For a stack, call it for every layer, not just the current branch or the top PR. This applies when creating or updating PRs through gh, gh stack, another CLI, or the host API: those operations do not register the PRs with this thread. Linking an already-linked PR is safe. Before finishing PR work, call list_thread_pull_requests and link any PR from your work that is missing. Do not link unrelated PRs mentioned only as background. If a linking call fails, report that failure instead of claiming the PR is linked.
</pull_request_linking>`;

const COMMIT_RECOMMENDATION_INSTRUCTIONS = `<commit_recommendations>
When the t3-code MCP server exposes set_commit_recommendation, reassess commit readiness before finishing a coding turn and when a meaningful milestone is reached. Use level "recommended" for a coherent, verified change that would make a sensible commit. Use "overdue" only when accumulated uncommitted work creates a concrete risk of mixing independent changes or losing a useful rollback point, and explain that risk in a short reason. Do not escalate just because time has passed or a file count is high. Use "none" to withdraw earlier advice if further work makes it premature. The tool updates an advisory indicator; it does not authorize or perform a commit. Respect the user's commit workflow and do not interrupt unfinished work just to recommend a commit.
