# Satellite

Satellite is a personal fork of T3 Code for experimenting with ideas that relate
directly to the maintainer's own workflow. Current experiments connect issue boards
and agent work in a desktop workspace. Read
[README.md](./README.md) for the fork's purpose and setup.

## Project priorities

- Keep the desktop workspace quick to open and cheap to keep running. Avoid
  excessive WebSocket payloads, expensive list rendering, and continuous animations.
- Build on the inherited provider and environment model. Complexity belongs at
  adapter boundaries; orchestration stays pure and clients render its state.
- Preserve local and remote execution. A remote client must act on the environment
  that owns the workspace, credentials, and filesystem.
- Windows desktop is the primary release target, and macOS desktop also ships. Web
  is the desktop renderer. Mobile is upstream's client; Satellite does not change it.
  Shared changes must account for those clients without expanding every desktop
  feature to all of them.
- This fork has its own issue tracker, release workflow, and product direction.
  Do not route Satellite work to upstream T3's maintainers or hosted services.

Prefer the smallest model that makes correct behavior unsurprising. Avoid scope
creep and unnecessary machinery. The maintainer may be using Satellite to direct
your work, so protect the running instance and its data.

## A small glossary

We need to be on the same page with terminology. When communicating, use this language:

- **you** means the agent reading this file and changing Satellite.
- **we, us, and maintainers** mean the people maintaining this Satellite fork.
- **user** means the person using Satellite to direct coding agents.
- **agent** means the coding agent a user runs inside Satellite. Depending on context, that may also include you.
- **provider** means the agent runtime or harness Satellite talks to, such as Codex, Claude, Cursor, or OpenCode.
- **client** means the web, desktop, or mobile UI.
- **environment** means one running Satellite server and the machine, filesystem, provider credentials, and state it owns.
- **project** means an environment-local workspace record rooted at a directory.
- **thread** means the durable conversation and work history for a project.
- **turn** means one user-to-agent cycle, including follow-up work such as checkpointing.
- **T3 home** is the inherited name for the server's base data directory. Runtime
  state lives below `userdata`; installed Satellite uses `~/.satellite-t3`.

## The three ways to hurt yourself

1. **Killing by pattern.** Never `pkill -f`, `pgrep | kill`, or `kill` a PID you found by matching a name, path, or worktree string. Your own agent process has this worktree's path in its argv, and this machine runs several other dev servers at once. Kill only a PID you captured at spawn, or the owner of your port from `ss -H -ltnp` after confirming `/proc/<pid>/cwd` is your worktree.
2. **Writing to the live install.** `~/.satellite-t3/userdata` and `~/.t3/userdata` are live installed-app data directories, potentially in use while you work. Reading and copying from them are fine, and a good way to get real test data (see Test data). Never start a server against them, open them read-write, or clean them up.
3. **Baking in origins.** Never set `VITE_HTTP_URL` or `VITE_WS_URL` for dev. Dev is single-origin and Vite proxies `/api`, `/ws`, `/oauth`, and `/.well-known`. Setting them bakes localhost into the bundle and silently breaks every remote browser.

## Hit every surface

The most common defect in this repo is a change that works on the path you tested and is missing everywhere else. Before calling frontend work done, walk this list and say which entries applied:

- **Entry points.** A behavior reachable from the chat view is usually also reachable from Settings, the command palette, and a keybinding. Fixing one is not fixing the feature.
- **Clients.** Web, desktop (wraps web, adds Electron shell/IPC), and mobile (React Native, separate navigation). Shared logic lives in `packages/client-runtime`. Satellite makes no changes to the mobile app, and the official T3 Code mobile app must keep working against a Satellite server.
- **Providers.** Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, OpenCode, and Antigravity each have an adapter. Provider-shaped features need a decision per adapter, even if the decision is "not supported here".
- **Agents.** A capability a user can trigger is usually one an agent should reach through MCP tools, and scheduled tasks run the same paths. That only works when it is a service method, not handler code.
- **Contracts.** Anything crossing the wire is typed in `packages/contracts`. Change the schema and the server, web, mobile, and desktop all follow.
- **Reverse states.** If you added a way in, add the way out and the way to see it. Snooze needs unsnooze. Close needs reopen. A one-way door is a bug.
- **Connection modes.** Local, remote/relay, and tunnel behave differently. Multi-device and multi-environment cases are real.
- **Docs.** Check whether the change makes existing guidance inaccurate. Apply the [documentation rules](#documentation) before adding anything.

## Dev servers

- `pnpm run dev:satellite` launches the desktop with server data under this checkout's `.t3/satellite/userdata`. See the README for profile isolation. It must never use live installed-app data.
- `vp i` (or `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`) installs. Worktrees get this from the t3.json setup script; if module resolution looks broken, it probably did not run.
- Setup runs in the background. While `.t3/setup-running` names a live PID, wait for it and do not run `vp i`. It ends with `.t3/setup-done` or `.t3/setup-failed` (with the error tail). With no marker at all, setup never ran here, so run `vp i` yourself.
- `vp run dev` starts server and web. In a worktree, state defaults to that worktree's gitignored `.t3`, which deliberately outranks an ambient `T3CODE_HOME` so you cannot land on shared state by accident. An explicit `--home-dir` still wins.
- Ports derive from the worktree path and are stable across restarts, but read the real ones from the `[dev-runner]` line since occupied ports shift.
- Sharing over the tailnet is three steps: run `vp run dev --share` in the background, wait for the `pairingUrl:` line in its output, then give that full URL to an unpaired browser. Do not wire up `tailscale serve` by hand, open the URL yourself, or consume the user's pairing link. A browser with the reusable dev cookie can use the bare origin. If a normal one-time token was consumed, mint a fresh one with `node apps/server/src/bin.ts pair`. It carries standard scopes, while the startup URL carries admin scopes needed for Connections settings.
- To reuse web dev auth across worktrees, configure one fixed `T3CODE_DEV_AUTH_TOKEN` in the main checkout's gitignored `.env`. The `t3.json` setup links that file into worktrees. Never commit or publish the token or a startup URL. See [Reusable dev credential](docs/operations/development.md#reusable-dev-credential).
- Stop what you started, by the PID you tracked. See rule 1.
- Need a second checkout? `git worktree add` it next to this worktree, not in `/tmp`. Remove it when done.

## Test data

An empty database is a bad test. Seed your worktree's `.t3` with a copy of real data instead of pointing at live state:

- Snapshot the installed Satellite 1.x database with `VACUUM INTO`. It is safe even while a server has the source open, yields one consistent file, and exercises the V1 to V2 migration:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p .t3/userdata
  rm -f .t3/userdata/state.sqlite* .t3/userdata/statev2.sqlite*  # VACUUM INTO refuses to overwrite
  bun -e "new (require('bun:sqlite').Database)(process.env.HOME + '/.satellite-t3/userdata/state.sqlite', { readonly: true }).run(\"VACUUM INTO '.t3/userdata/state.sqlite'\")"
  ```

  A plain `cp` is only safe when no server has the source open, and must bring the `-wal` and `-shm` siblings along. A live file copy is a corrupt copy.

- The server builds its V2 `statev2.sqlite` from the V1 `state.sqlite` only when `statev2.sqlite` is missing. Delete your worktree's `statev2.sqlite` to rerun that migration.
- Once Satellite 2.x data exists, the first `vp run dev` in a worktree with no database seeds it from a read-only snapshot of `~/.satellite-t3/userdata/statev2.sqlite` when that file is at most 500 MiB. A larger source warns and dev starts with an empty database; seed it by hand with the refresh command below. `--no-seed` or `T3CODE_DEV_SEED=0` skips seeding.
- To refresh, run `vp run migrate-dev-db --source ~/.satellite-t3/userdata/statev2.sqlite` with your dev server stopped. It rebuilds `<worktree>/.t3/userdata/statev2.sqlite` from a read-only snapshot, keeps recent projects and their stopped threads, and drops scheduled tasks, pending work, and auth sessions, so your dev server never runs the user's agents. Always pass `--source`; its default reads `~/.t3`.
- Bring `secrets` and `settings.json` only if the flow under test needs them.
- Copy in, never symlink. Data flows one way: into your sandbox, never back out.

## Verifying

- Before you push, run `vp run check:changed`. It runs CI's fast checks for changed files: format, lint, knip, typecheck of affected packages and dependents, and tests beside changes. CI still runs the full test suites.
- While you iterate, run `vp test run <files>`. For big files, add `-t "<name>"`.
- Use `vp run typecheck`, not `npx tsc`; it caches per package. Both run tsc-rs (`typescript` is the `@tsc-rs/typescript` drop-in).
- Run `node -e` snippets from `apps/server` or the owning package. `effect` does not resolve from the repo root.
- Test meaningful logic or observable behavior. Do not render components to static markup to assert props or attributes, or add tests that merely assert callback wiring or mirror the implementation.
- **Do not run repo-wide checks.** No `vp check`, no `vp run -r test`, no `vp run -r typecheck` unless I ask. CI owns the full suite.
- Backend behavior changes ship with focused tests for that behavior.
- Proof for a bug fix depends on the bug. Logic, data, state, and protocol bugs get a failing test first (the fewest that fail on `main` for that reason, in the module's existing test file), then the fix. Purely visual bugs (spacing, colour, alignment, a layout shift) get before/after captures as their proof and no test: do not add UI tests for nitpicks, and do not ask for one in review when a capture already shows it. A server-only fix with no visible surface ships the test plus a short runtime transcript.
- The server is event-sourced, and side effects run after the command commits. In tests, drain the effect worker (`OrchestrationEffectWorkerV2.drain`) or await the specific persisted event or `Deferred` that marks the milestone. Never wait on sleeps or polling. A test that needs a timeout to pass is wrong. Concretely:
  - `it.effect` runs on a `TestClock`; `Effect.sleep` only advances through `TestClock.adjust`. `it.live` is wall-clock and only for subprocess or network fixtures.
  - No `yieldNow` or `sleep` polling loops. Await the `Deferred`, take from the `Queue`, or drain the worker.
  - No per-test timeout argument or `retry`. The project timeout is the ceiling, and flaky tests are fixed, not retried.
  - No `performance.now()` or `Date.now()` deltas. Assert on events and counts, not elapsed time.
  - Browser tests assert through `expect.element` or `vi.waitFor`, never `requestAnimationFrame` or `transitionend`.
  - `vi.mock` factories must not spread a real module that pulls in Shiki or the diff workers.
  - `it.skip` and friends need a tracking issue on the line above: `// quarantine: #1234 <why>`.
  - Lint enforces this: `t3code/no-test-timeout-or-unreasoned-skip`, `t3code/no-frame-waits-in-browser-tests`, `t3code/no-wall-clock-in-tests`, `t3code/no-real-time-wait-in-tests`, `t3code/no-polling-loop-in-tests`.
- Web browser tests are `*.browser.test.tsx` or `*.browser.test.ts` and render with `await using screen = await render(...)` from `apps/web/test/render.tsx`. `t3code/require-disposable-render` errors on the old patterns.
  - Acquire what the test drives after mounting (fake timers it advances, spies it sets up after mounting) after the render, so it disposes before the unmount. Anything the first render reads comes before it.
  - A helper that renders and then waits or clicks puts the screen in an `AsyncDisposableStack` and `move()`s it out only on success, so a failed wait still unmounts.
  - `rerender` needs a fresh element on every call.
  - No lifecycle hooks and no module-level mutable state. Shared mock state that `vi.mock` factories read is reset by a `setup()` call at the top of the test.
  - `router` is on by default. Pass `router: false` only with a one-line comment saying why.

  ```tsx
  it("saves on Enter", async () => {
    const onSave = vi.fn();
    using _now = vi.spyOn(Date, "now").mockReturnValue(0);
    await using screen = await render(<TitleEditor onSave={onSave} />, { router: "/threads/1" });
    await userEvent.type(screen.getByRole("textbox"), "Title{Enter}");
    expect(onSave).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Title");
  });
  ```

- Upon request, user-visible frontend changes should get one integrated pass in a real client: `test-t3-app` for web, `test-t3-mobile` for mobile. The primary agent does this once after integrating. Subagents do not launch their own dev servers. Ask permission before doing computer use or spinning up browsers.

For authorized mobile verification, a missing or outdated native client is an install step, not a blocker. Run `vp run mobile:install <ios|android> [device-id]` on the device host before starting Metro; it targets the only booted simulator or connected Android device when the id is omitted. It installs the dev client for this checkout's native fingerprint from the shared cache in seconds and builds only when no machine has built it yet, so prefer it over `expo run:*`, `xcodebuild`, or `gradlew`, which rebuild from scratch. Its stdout is one JSON line; build output goes to the log it names. See `test-t3-mobile` for the full workflow.

## Pull requests

- Never make a PR unless the developer explicitly asks you to do so.
- This repository is a GitHub fork of `pingdotgg/t3code`, so `gh` defaults new PRs to upstream. Run `gh repo set-default RobertScholey98/Satellite_T3` once per machine. V2 port PRs target the `satellite-v2` branch of the fork.
- Conventional commit titles, plain language: `fix(web): new threads no longer spike CPU`.
- Body: the problem in a sentence or two, then how you fixed it. End with the model and harness that did the work.
- UI changes need before/after images. Motion or timing needs a short video.
- Upload PR evidence to GitHub. Never commit PR-only screenshots or assets such as `.github/pr-assets/`.
- One concern per PR. If the description says "also", split it.
- List the upstream files a PR touches with `node scripts/upstream-files.ts <base>..<head>` (`--first-parent` for the branch's own commits).
- When babysitting: poll checks and comments newer than the last push, verify each bot finding against the source, fix real ones, dismiss false positives with a written reason. Stay quiet when nothing is new. Stop when the bots are green on the latest commit.

## Documentation

Most code changes do not need an internal documentation change. Agents can read the code.

- `docs/internals/` is for architectural decisions and their reasons, constraints that span components, and implementation traps that are hard to discover from the source. Before adding a paragraph, ask what a maintainer would get wrong without it. If reading the relevant code answers the question, leave it out.
- Do not document every feature, enumerate fields or methods, narrate control flow, maintain file catalogs, or append PR summaries. Types, tests, and code already record the implementation. The glossary defines shared vocabulary; it is not a feature index.
- A local reason the code can't show goes in a short nearby code comment. Use an internal doc when the reasoning crosses boundaries or needs context the code cannot carry well. Link to the relevant source instead of copying it.
- When a documented decision or constraint changes, rewrite or remove the affected text. Do not append another account of the new behavior. A new internal page needs a distinct, durable reason to exist.
- `docs/user/` helps users accomplish tasks. Give each major feature a concise section explaining what it does, how to start, and anything unintuitive. A settings path is useful; descriptions of visible buttons, icons, layouts, animations, or every UI state are not. Before adding text, ask what task or decision it helps the user with.
- Keep user docs in the shipped product's voice, without implementation details or contributor tooling. Update the relevant feature section when how to use it changes. A UI tweak does not need a documentation entry, and a new control does not need its own page.
- `docs/operations/` holds maintainer setup, release, and debugging procedures. Keep instructions for operating an installed Satellite server in the user guides.

## Plans and work artifacts

- Do not commit implementation plans, research notes, or agent scratch files. Keep temporary working material outside the worktree. `.plans/` is gitignored only as a safety net for legacy tooling.
- Track active maintainer work in the GitHub issue or project item that owns it. Bug reports and proposals follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` and belong in this fork's issues.
- A merged PR is the implementation record. Close or update its tracking item when the work lands; do not preserve a second checklist in the repository.

## Fork constraints

Satellite stays a thin layer on upstream so that upstream can be merged forward. The reasons are in
[Satellite fork constraints](docs/internals/satellite-fork-constraints.md); the merge procedure is the
[upstream sync runbook](docs/operations/upstream-sync.md).

- **Contracts only grow.** The official mobile app connects to Satellite servers. Add WS methods, union members, and optional fields; never rename, remove, or reshape an upstream contract. Keep upstream's orchestration protocol version.
- **Satellite schema lives outside upstream's migration ledger.** Satellite migrations run from their own table with their own ids. Never add or renumber an upstream migration.
- **Satellite code is additive.** Features are new services, contracts files, components, and MCP tools. Upstream files change only at registration points, and each PR names the ones it touches.
- **Register through fork-owned modules.** One server module, one WS RPC module, one RPC registry, one RPC contracts file, one product identity contract, and one web root coordinator each reach upstream through a line or two.
- **Satellite's major version stays above upstream's**, so the mobile app never offers an upstream server update.

## How it works

Clients send typed WebSocket requests. The server turns them into _commands_. The _orchestrator_ (`apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/Orchestrator.ts`) serializes commands and decides _events_ without doing any I/O. The _event sink_ commits those events, the _projections_ the UI reads, the _command receipt_, and _outbox_ effects in one transaction. The _effect worker_ then runs the effects, such as starting a provider turn or capturing a checkpoint, and feeds results back as commands. Provider CLIs run as subprocesses; per-provider _adapters_ translate their native protocols into orchestration events. Each turn ends with a _checkpoint_, a hidden git ref, so the app can diff and restore.

Architecture and its constraints: `docs/internals/overview.md`. Glossary: `docs/internals/glossary.md`

## Where code lives

- `apps/server` - WebSocket, orchestration, providers, checkpointing. Effect-heavy: read [Effect services](docs/internals/effect-services.md) before adding server code, and `.repos/effect-smol/LLMS.md` for the Effect library itself.
- `apps/web` - React/Vite UI. `apps/desktop` wraps it, `apps/mobile` is upstream's React Native client, `apps/marketing` is upstream's site.
- `packages/contracts` - Effect/Schema contracts plus small derived helpers. No heavy runtime logic.
- `packages/shared` - shared runtime utils, subpath exports, no barrel.
- `packages/client-runtime` - client code shared by web and mobile.
- `.repos/` - vendored read-only references. Prefer their patterns over invented ones. Never edit or import from them. Sync with `vpr sync:repos` when bumping the matching dependency. If it is missing (sparse checkout), read a file with `git show origin/main:.repos/<path>`.

## Taste

- Complexity belongs at the adapter boundary. Orchestration stays pure, UI stays dumb.
- Client mutations use `createEnvironmentRpcCommand`. Add protected methods to `CLIENT_GUARDED_RPC_SCOPES` in contracts and use the command's `permissionAtom` for UI availability. Grants are checked at execution against the destination environment; the server remains authoritative. Keep raw RPC clients inside `rpc/`, and extend the permission behavior tests when adding a protected method.
- Server features are services; transports stay thin. A `ws.ts` RPC handler, HTTP route, or MCP tool decodes input, calls one service method, and maps errors. See [Effect services](docs/internals/effect-services.md).
- `apps/web/src/components/ui` exports own their look. Pick a `variant` or `size`; do not restyle one with `className`. If none fits and the look is a generic concept, add a variant to the component; a look that belongs to one feature stays in that feature's own component, not in `components/ui`. Layout classes (width, flex, margin, position) belong on the parent. `shadcn/no-restyle` fails lint on violations. See [Web UI](docs/internals/web-ui.md).
- Reusable Effect functions use `Effect.fn("Service.operation")` with a stable span name, not a
  function wrapping `Effect.gen`. Keep `Effect.gen` for inline programs and layer construction.
  Use `Effect.fnUntraced` only when spans would be too frequent (stream chunks, per-event
  projection, tight loops) or duplicate an existing tracing boundary; explain that choice nearby.
  Named `Effect.fn` creates a span; the unnamed form does not. Preserve existing span names and
  options, and pass combinators as additional function-builder arguments.
- Inferred types over annotations. `any` is the enemy.
- Default to no comment. Write one only for a constraint, an external quirk, or an invariant the code can't show, in one line where you can and four at most. Don't restate names or signatures, narrate steps, record history, or explain the fix you just made; the PR carries that. `t3code/no-low-value-comments` enforces the length cap and the mechanical cases.
- React effects are for synchronizing with something outside React. Derive in render and act in handlers instead of syncing state, but don't hide real lifecycle work in refs or stores to dodge one. The `t3code/react-effect-budget` lint rule holds each file to its count in `scripts/effect-budget.json`; a new effect states its reason with `// oxlint-disable-next-line t3code/react-effect-budget -- <why>`.
- Our users drive agents all day and notice a dropped frame, a lying spinner, and a stale label. No continuously repainting animations; they peg the GPU on high-refresh displays.
- If a rule here fights the task in front of you, say so loudly and get a human sign-off before breaking it.

## Additional tips

- Don't verify with browsers or computer use unless the user explicitly agrees or requests it.
- Security is important, but should not be over-indexed on, especially for dev mode/maintainer-only features.
